## Discussion and Conclusions

BioRxiv is a popular repository that contains life science preprints; however, the language contained within these preprints remains unknwon.
Throughout this work we sought to analyze this language and understand how it changes in response to the peer review process.
Through our global corpora analysis we found that writing within bioRxiv is consistent with the biomedical literature contained in the PMCOA repository, suggesting that bioRxiv is linguistically similar to PMCOA.
Token-level analyses between bioRxiv and PMCOA suggested that major differences are driven by research fields where more patient related research is prevelant in PMCOA than bioRxiv.
This observation is expected as patient preprints are funnled from bioRxiv into the medRxiv repository [@url:https://www.medrxiv.org/].
We observed that life science preprints were separated on an informatics / molecular axis, suggesting that majority of life science research involves some form of a cellular biology type of approach or an informatics type of approach.

Preprints are typicaly linked with their published articles via bioRxiv manually establishing a link or authors self-report their preprint being published; however, gaps can occur as preprints change their appearence through multiple versions or authors do not notify bioRxiv. 
We found that some preprints are high similar to published articles within the PMC open access corpus, and our detailed examination revealed that many preprints were published but not previously annotated.
Using the full text of documents to correct these missing annotations provides a comprehensive understanding of the extent to which preprints are published and this correction resulted in a publication rate that is higher than previously estimated.
Importantly, this only accounts for papers that are published open access, so our analysis should be considered to raise the lower bound but the truly published fraction is likely to be higher.
In any case, future work, especially that which aims to assess the fraction of preprints that are eventually published, should account for the possibility of missed annotations.

Our work presents an early step towards understanding the process by which peer review alters life sciences papers through an analysis of the full text of preprints and their corresponding publication.
Comparisons of preprints with their corresponding publication revealed differences in typesetting and supplementary materials, suggesting that the majority of peer review changes are modest at best. 
This lays the groundwork for future endeavors that aims to identify sentences and claims that are altered during the peer review process.
We also discovered it takes approximately 50 days for preprints to venture through the peer review process, which with future endeavors can aide researcherss in understanding which parts of the review process takes the most time.

Lastly, we found that document embeddings were associated with the eventual journal at which the work was published and trained models to idenfity which journals publish similar papers to a preprint.
Our models achieved modest results, which proposes that fututre work should include more information than solely textual content when idenfityinn which journal venues are appropiate for authors' preprints.
Nevertheless, we constructed a web application that returns a list of the papers and journals that are most similar to a bioRxiv or medRxiv preprint.
