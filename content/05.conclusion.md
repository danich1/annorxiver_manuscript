## Discussion and Conclusions

<!--
1.Recap bioRxiv's global analysis and reinforce the point that  bioRxiv is lingusitically similar to PMCOA
2. Talk about the language within BioRxiv itself and how it contains biological concepts of PCs
3. Mention that the token differences we found are related to the demands of peer review and it suggests that overall effects of peer rview are more modest than we realized

BioRxiv is a popular repository that contains life science preprints; however, not much is known about the language contained within preprints.
Through our global corpora analysis we found that writing within bioRxiv is consistent with the biomedical literature contained in the PMCOA repository, suggesting that bioRxiv is linguistically similar to PMCOA.
Token-level analyses between bioRxiv and PMCOA suggested that major differences are driven by research fields where more patient related research is prevelant in PMCOA than bioRxiv. 
Comparisons of preprints with their corresponding publication reveals differences in typesetting and supplementary materials, which suggests that the majority of peer review changes are modest at best.

1. Talk about missing preprint links
2. Mention how our findings reinforce the point that misssing links is a critical factor that once accounted for will refute  initial skepticism on preprint publication success
-->
Previous analyses have focused on article metadata, including which papers are heavily downloaded and discussed [@doi:10.7554/eLife.45133] and by which communities discuss them [@doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.3000860].
We found that some preprints are highly similar to published articles within the PMC open access corpus, and a detailed examination revealed that many preprints were published but not previously annotated.
Using the full text of documents to correct these missing annotations provides a comprehensive understanding of the extent to which preprints are published and this correction resulted in a publication rate that is higher than previously estimated.
Importantly, this only accounts for papers that are published open access, so our analysis should be considered to raise the lower bound but the truly published fraction is likely to be higher.

1. Discuss how peer review delays preprint publications
2. Mention how that we need to study more about peer review changes, but inital results suggest peer review ends up with modest changes on preprints
3. Authors take X amount of time to make request changes
4. Highlight that data availability is important
-->
Our work presents a first step towards understanding the process by which peer review alters life sciences papers through an analysis of the full text of preprints and their corresponding publication.
Our broad-based examination suggests certain changes, but the scale of changes appears modest.
We lay the groundwork for future work that aims to identify sentences and claims that are altered during review.
Our finding that document embeddings reveal manuscripts with similar outcomes is likely to be important to new tools that accelerate publishing, including those that automatically perform integrity checks and other critically important contributions.
We also found that document embeddings captured many elements of how authors use language in preprints.
Fields were separated first on an informatics / molecular axis, and author-selected categories could be distinguished based on embeddings.
Document embeddings were also associated with the eventual journal at which the work was published.
Based on this observation, we supply a web application that returns the papers and journals that are most similar to a bioRxiv or medRxiv preprint.

1. Lastly talk about website generation
2. Talk about how determining journal venues isn't a simple task as other factors than just preprint content is needed to make an informed decision.  (Idk what these factors are but would be good to include an example)
