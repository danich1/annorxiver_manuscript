## Introduction

Scientific communication has been around since the beginning of science where one of the earliest paradigms was oral communication [@doi:10.1021/ci00050a001].
During the 17th century, the predominate form of communication shifted to personal letters that were shared from one scientist to another [@doi:10.1021/ci00050a001].
Scientific journals didn't take precedence until the
19th and 20th century where the first journal abstract was created [@doi:10.1021/ci00050a001; @raw:smith2006trouble; @doi:10.1300/J123v41n01_04].
Although scientific journals became the primary source of communication, they came with a number of problems such as high maintenance costs and long publication times [@raw:smith2006trouble; @doi:10.1300/J123v41n01_04].
Preprints, scholarly works that have yet to undergo peer review process, were used as a means to circumvent some of the perils generated by scientific journals [@doi:10.1177/0192623318767322; @doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.2003995].

Preprints are hosted on online repositories, where users have open and easy access to these works.
Notable repositories include arXiv [@doi:10.1108/14666180010345564], bioRxiv [@doi:10.1101/833400] and medRxiv [@url:https://www.medrxiv.org/]; however, there are over 60 different repositories available [@url:https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2019/10/16/the-second-wave-of-preprint-servers-how-can-publishers-keep-afloat/].
In respect to lifes science the majroity of work focused on the metadata behind the bioRxiv repository.
For example, scientists found that life science preprints are being posted at an increase rate [@doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.3000269].
Furthermore, these preprints are also being rapidly shared on social media, routinely downloaded, and cited [@doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0047523].
Certain categories of preprints seem to be read and shared differently by both scientists and non-scientists [@doi:10.1101/2020.03.06.981589].
Plus, life science articles with matching preprint versions are cited and discussed more often than articles without them [@doi:10.1162/qss_a_00043; @doi:10.7554/eLife.52646; @doi:10.12688/f1000research.19619.2].
Studies of the modern life sciences preprint repositories have primarily focused on the metadata associated with preprints; however, the textual content contained within this repositories has yet to be examined.

Textual analysis is a methodology that uses linguistic, statsitical and machine learning techniques to analyze and extract information from text [@doi:10.1111/1475-679X.12123]. 
Theses set of techniques made a size able impact within the life science community by providing foresight on linguistic similarities and differences of biomedical corpora [@doi:10.1186/1471-2105-10-183;10.1186/1471-2105-9-S3-S6; @pmc:PMC442180], providing advise on how to train and test future text processing systems [@doi:10.1186/1471-2105-11-492; @doi:10.1186/1471-2105-13-207; @doi:10.1186/s12859-019-2604-0] and providing the community with to tools that can aide future text mining systems [@doi:10.1093/bib/bbs084; @doi:10.1093/nar/gkz389; @doi:10.1186/s12859-017-1775-9].
Based on previous impact of this field, we sought to use this type of methodology for the bioRxiv repository.
Plus, to our knowledge this is the first time textual analysis has been conducted on the bioRxiv repository.

Preprints repositories receive a enormous amount of preprint submissions that can result in a number of issues [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1008565].
Due to this influx of preprints, preprint respositories have a hard time searching and linking preprints with their published counter parts. @doi:10.1038/530265a; @doi:10.7554/eLife.52646]
Furthermore, these repositories lack methods to show how preprints change when subjected to the peer reivew processs [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1008565].
These repositories are open access for all to view preprints; however, this openness provides causes fear in reserachers that their work may be stolen by cometitors[@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1008565; @doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.3000151].
Also, since these repositories do not have in-depth peer reivew that can result in prerpints containing low quality results being posted [@doi:10.12688/f1000research.19619.2; @doi:10.1007/s10393-018-1352-3; @doi:10.1038/530265a; @doi:10.1016/j.bpj.2016.06.035].
Previous work found that between two-thirds to three-quarters of preprints are eventually published [@doi:10.7554/eLife.45133.001; @doi:10.1002/pra2.175].
In respect to time, previous work estimated that preprints take an average of 160 days to become published [@doi:10.2139/ssrn.3455146], while preprints with a single version often take less time than preprints with multiple versions [@doi:10.2139/ssrn.3455146].

Need to add connection for motivation on this work in respect to holess within repositories,
</div>

In this work we sought to understand the language contained within the bioRxiv repository and contextualize how this language changes under the guise of peer review.
By undergoing this study we can provide insight to the scientific community on exactly which textual sections are altered due to peer review.
Furthermore, we provide users with the ability to see which journals othe preprints have been sent.
Plus, we this work can aide repositories with an automated system to find missing links between preprints and their published versions.

Still working on this section.

Casey Comment:
I think Larry wanted more than the primacy argument for significance:
Why is this being done? There needs to be a significance argument here. There are controversies about preprints â€” how will this work address them?

Are there any interesting/important reasons to study this?
</div>

STILL TODO for me

Casey Comment:
I think this got left out:
Once the motivation for doing the work is clear, provide a separate paragraph about the motivation for the particular pre-analytical choices about approach.

The changes to the results sections are also starting to remove these elements, so if your broad approach isn't justified here, that justification isn't going to be in the manuscript at all.
