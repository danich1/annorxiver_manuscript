## Introduction

Scientific communication has been around since the beginning of science where the main form of communication was through scientific meetings [@raw:smith2006trouble].
Communicating through scientific journals started back in the 17th century [@raw:smith2006trouble] but didn't pick up until the 1960s where National Institutes of Health (NIH) created an exchange network that allowed scientists to share unreferred manuscripts with one another [@doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.2003995].
These networks were brough to a halt due to pressure from scientific journals; however, this sparked a movement to begin using preprints within the scientific community [@doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.2003995]. 
The longest recorded use of preprints was with physicists during the 1990s [@doi:10.15252/embj.201695531] and over the past few decades preprints have made a resurgence within the life sciences community [@doi:10.7554/eLife.45133.001' @doi:10.1038/530265a; @doi:10.1016/j.bpj.2016.06.035; @doi:10.1126/science.aaf9133; @doi:10.1038/s41557-020-0477-5; @doi:10.1371/journal.pmed.1002549; @doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.3000151; @doi:10.1099/mgen.0.000259].

Preprints are now hosted on online repositories, where users have open and easy access to these works.
Notable repositories include arXiv [@doi:10.1108/14666180010345564], bioRxiv [@doi:10.1101/833400] and medRxiv [@url:https://www.medrxiv.org/]; however, there are over 60 different repositories available [@url:https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2019/10/16/the-second-wave-of-preprint-servers-how-can-publishers-keep-afloat/].
Previous work that focused on the bioRxiv repository found that life science preprints are being posted at an increase rate [@doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.3000269].
Furthermore, these preprints are also being rapidly shared on social media, routinely downloaded, and cited [@doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0047523].
Certain categories of preprints seem to be read and shared differently by both scientists and non-scientists [@doi:10.1101/2020.03.06.981589].
Plus, life science articles with matching preprint versions are cited and discussed more often than articles without them [@doi:10.1162/qss_a_00043; @doi:10.7554/eLife.52646].
These studies have primarily focused on the metadata behind preprints; however, the textual content contained within preprints has yet to be examined.

Preprints have often faced skepticism within the life science community [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1008565; @doi:10.1136/bmj.m3111; @doi:10.1007/s10393-018-1352-3; @doi:10.1073/pnas.1511912112].
One particular problem focuses on the publication process and the time it takes for preprints to become published.
Previous work found that between two-thirds to three-quarters of preprints are eventually published [@doi:10.7554/eLife.45133.001; @doi:10.1002/pra2.175].
In respect to time, previous work estimated that preprints take an average of 160 days to become published [@doi:10.2139/ssrn.3455146], while preprints with a single version often take less time than preprints with multiple versions [@doi:10.2139/ssrn.3455146].
Despite these discoveries a missing piece is understanding which part of a preprint changes during the peer review process.

In this work we sought to understand the language landscape within the bioRxiv corpus and contextualize how this language changes under the guise of peer review.
To our knowledge this is the first time anyone has conducted a linguistic analysis on this repository.
One benefit of analyzing this repository is that we can examine the influence of the publication process and ascertain how this process impacts scholarly literature on a global scale.
