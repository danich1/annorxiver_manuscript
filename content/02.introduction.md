## Introduction

The dissemination of research findings is key to science, and initially much of this communication happened orally [@doi:10.1021/ci00050a001].
During the 17th century, the predominate form of communication shifted to personal letters that were shared from one scientist to another [@doi:10.1021/ci00050a001].
Scientific journals didn't become a predominant mode of communication until the
19th and 20th centuries when the first journal abstract was created [@doi:10.1021/ci00050a001; @raw:smith2006trouble; @doi:10.1300/J123v41n01_04].
Although scientific journals became the primary method of communication, they added high maintenance costs and long publication times to scientific discourse [@raw:smith2006trouble; @doi:10.1300/J123v41n01_04].
Scientists' solution to some of these issues was to communicate through preprints, which are scholarly works that have yet to undergo peer review process [@doi:10.1177/0192623318767322; @doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.2003995].

Preprints are commonly hosted on online repositories, where users have open and easy access to these works.
Notable repositories include arXiv [@doi:10.1108/14666180010345564], bioRxiv [@doi:10.1101/833400] and medRxiv [@url:https://www.medrxiv.org/]; however, there are over 60 different repositories available [@url:https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2019/10/16/the-second-wave-of-preprint-servers-how-can-publishers-keep-afloat/].
The burgeoning uptake of preprints in life sciences has been examined through research focused on metadata from the bioRxiv repository.
For example, scientists found that life science preprints are being posted at an increasingly high rate [@doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.3000269].
Furthermore, these preprints are being rapidly shared on social media, routinely downloaded, and cited [@doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0047523].
Certain preprint categories are read and shared by both scientists and non-scientists alike [@doi:10.1101/2020.03.06.981589].
Overall, about two-thirds to three-quarters of preprints are eventually published [@doi:10.7554/eLife.45133.001; @doi:10.1002/pra2.175] and life science articles that have a corresponding preprint version are cited and discussed more often than articles without them [@doi:10.1162/qss_a_00043; @doi:10.7554/eLife.52646; @doi:10.12688/f1000research.19619.2].
Preprints take an average of 160 days to become published [@doi:10.2139/ssrn.3455146], and those with multiple versions take longer to publish [@doi:10.2139/ssrn.3455146].

In spite of the success and excitement of preprints, there are number of issues that arose from their constant use.
Preprint repositories receive a growing number of submissions, which poses challenges for this mode of communication [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1008565].
For example, repositories have a hard time searching and linking preprints with their published counterparts [@doi:10.1038/530265a; @doi:10.7554/eLife.52646], which results in missing links and consequently erroneous metadata.
Furthermore, these repositories lack tools to show how textual content of preprints are altered due to the peer review process [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1008565].
These repositories are open access for all to view preprints, which results in concern from scientists that they could be scooped by competitors [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1008565; @doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.3000151].
Plus, preprint repositories do not have in-depth peer review which can result in posted preprints containing inconsistent results or conclusions [@doi:10.12688/f1000research.19619.2; @doi:10.1007/s10393-018-1352-3; @doi:10.1038/530265a; @doi:10.1016/j.bpj.2016.06.035].
Despite a growing emphasis on using the study of preprints to examine the publishing process in the life sciences, how these findings related to the text of documents within bioRxiv has not been examined.


Textual analysis is a methodology that uses linguistic, statistical and machine learning techniques to analyze and extract information from text [@doi:10.1111/1475-679X.12123]. 
This set of techniques have made a sizable impact within the life science community by providing valuable insight on biomedical text.
For instance, scientists analyzed linguistic similarities and differences of biomedical corpora [@doi:10.1186/1471-2105-10-183;10.1186/1471-2105-9-S3-S6; @pmc:PMC442180].
Scientists have provided the community with a number of tools that aide future text mining systems [@doi:10.1093/bib/bbs084; @doi:10.1093/nar/gkz389; @doi:10.1186/s12859-017-1775-9] as well as advice on how to train and test future text processing systems [@doi:10.1186/1471-2105-11-492; @doi:10.1186/1471-2105-13-207; @doi:10.1186/s12859-019-2604-0].
We used textual analysis to examine the bioRxiv repository, placing a particular emphasis on understanding the extent to which full text analysis can address hypotheses derived from the analysis of metadata alone.


Through this work we can contextualize how this language changes under the guise of peer review and provide initial insight on which sections are altered.
Furthermore, this work provides an opportunity to improve repository functionality and motivate future ideas on augmenting preprint repository capabilities.

We accomplished the above goals through a set of analyses.
We examined textual differences between preprints and published literature by comparing the entire corpus of preprints with articles available in the open access PubMed Central repository.
We also examined linguistic differences between individual preprints and their corresponding published pairs to emphasize textual changes on a global scale. 
Neural-network derived document embeddings provide a useful space for determining the textual similarity of preprints, which enables us to extend this work beyond word frequencies.
Examining articles with particularly close proximity in this space reveals unannotated preprint-publication pairs that earlier analyses could not consider. 
We used this space to observe the association between embedding distances and time elapsed for a preprint to be published.
Furthermore, within this space a preprintâ€™s nearest neighbors are also more likely than distant articles to share an eventual publishing venue with the preprint itself. 
We utilized this fact by providing a webserver that will display neighboring journals and articles for any preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, which can help authors identify similar papers or suitable journals.
